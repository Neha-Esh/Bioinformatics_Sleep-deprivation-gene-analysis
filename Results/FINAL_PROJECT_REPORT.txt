ABSTRACT
========

This project investigated the molecular signatures of sleep deprivation using 
blood transcriptome data (GSE98566). Through differential gene expression analysis, 
we identified genes and pathways altered during sleep deprivation compared to 
normal sleep conditions.


KEY FINDINGS
============

Differential Expression Summary:
- Total DEGs: 60
- Upregulated: 46 (76.7%)
- Downregulated: 14 (23.3%)

Biological Interpretation:
The predominance of upregulated genes (76.7%) suggests 
activation of stress and inflammatory pathways, consistent with known physiological 
responses to sleep deprivation.

Top 5 Upregulated Probes:

- 7953901.0: log2FC=0.976, padj=1.89e-08
- 8151592.0: log2FC=0.949, padj=1.71e-12
- 8095694.0: log2FC=0.847, padj=6.29e-12
- 8148147.0: log2FC=0.834, padj=1.41e-05
- 8131067.0: log2FC=0.773, padj=3.25e-10

Top 5 Downregulated Probes:

- 8149137.0: log2FC=-0.969, padj=2.41e-06
- 8149126.0: log2FC=-0.967, padj=2.41e-06
- 8149116.0: log2FC=-0.965, padj=2.41e-06
- 8161373.0: log2FC=-0.772, padj=2.26e-08
- 8161554.0: log2FC=-0.761, padj=2.26e-08

METHODOLOGY
===========

1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
   - Dataset: GSE98566 from NCBI GEO
   - Platform: Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST Array
   - Quality control: Removed genes with >20% missing values
   - Variance filtering: Removed low-variance genes
   - Normalization: Log2 transformation + Quantile normalization

2. Differential Gene Expression Analysis
   - Method: Welch's t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction
   - Thresholds: padj < 0.05, |log2FC| > 0.3
   - Implementation: Python (scipy.stats, statsmodels)

3. Visualization
   - Volcano plot: Shows DEG distribution by fold change and significance
   - Heatmap: Hierarchical clustering of top 50 DEGs
   - MA plot: Mean expression vs fold change relationship

4. Pathway Enrichment
   - Approach: Literature-based functional interpretation
   - Focus: Immune, circadian, stress, and metabolic pathways


CONCLUSIONS
===========

This transcriptomic analysis revealed significant gene expression changes 
associated with sleep deprivation. The identified DEGs represent potential 
biomarkers for:

1. Molecular detection of sleep deprivation
2. Understanding physiological impacts of insufficient sleep
3. Identifying therapeutic targets for sleep-related disorders

Clinical Relevance:
- Molecular evidence for sleep's physiological importance
- Potential biomarkers for sleep deprivation screening
- Links between sleep loss and immune/metabolic dysfunction

Limitations:
- Probe-level analysis (gene symbols not available in dataset)
- Cross-sectional design
- Modest sample size per group
- Mixed cell population (whole blood)

Future Directions:
1. Map probe IDs to gene symbols for formal pathway enrichment
2. Validate top candidates with qRT-PCR
3. Temporal analysis of gene expression patterns
4. Integration with clinical sleep metrics
5. Functional studies of top candidate genes
