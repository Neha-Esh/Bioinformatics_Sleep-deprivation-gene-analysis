BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION:
  The predominance of upregulated genes (77%) suggests 
  activation of stress and inflammatory pathways, consistent
  with known physiological responses to sleep deprivation.

  Expected pathways affected:
    - Immune response activation
    - Inflammatory signaling
    - Stress response pathways
    - Metabolic dysregulation

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Annotate top probes with gene symbols (GPL6244)
  2. Compare with published sleep studies
  3. Consider validation with qRT-PCR
  4. Investigate temporal dynamics if applicable

CONCLUSION:
  Sleep deprivation significantly alters expression of 60 probes
  in blood, providing molecular evidence for physiological impact
  of insufficient sleep.
